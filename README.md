# CodingTask

I did my internship at Bookiply in Malaga (Spain), There backend developers program in Java. 
I had only experience with C# and Javascript at the time. To see how good I was they gave me a coding assessment to determine my level.
This is the same assessment that new potential hirers need to take when they apply as a backend developer.
